# Hello there ðŸ‘‹ (general Kenobi)
I'm **Petr** - I'm a freelance developer currently cooperating with [DRIE](https://drie.cz/), IT Business Partner by profession, owner of semi-official Discord server for PEF MENDELU and computer science student at MENDELU. I'm open to new technologies and I love to try new languages and approaches to software development. I work on a lot of small projects for my personal needs. I am currently learning how generative AI works using ComfyUI.
