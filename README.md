# Hello there ðŸ‘‹ (general Kenobi)
I'm **Petr** - I'm a freelance developer, IT Business Partner by profession, owner of unofficial Discord server for PEF MENDELU and computer science student at MENDELU. I'm open to new technologies and I love to try new languages and approaches to software development. I work on a lot of small projects for my personal needs. I am currently learning how to migrate monolithic architecture to microservices, as I will be doing my bachelor thesis on this topic.
